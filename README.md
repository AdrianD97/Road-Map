        # Road-Map, university project
        
    Modeling a road map in the form of an oriented graph.
    
    The program determines: 
        - the most crowded city
        - the validity of the road map
        - cities inaccessible to a city
        - the nearest gas station where a car can feed
        - the route frequented by most travelers
        
     The program is implemented in C++, using data structures implemented by me, such as: generic graph and generic hashtable.
     
     Program testing is done automatically by running the check.sh script.
     The goal of the cpplin.py script is to identify places in the code that may be in non-compliance with google style.
